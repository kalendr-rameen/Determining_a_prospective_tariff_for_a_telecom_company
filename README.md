# Determining_a_prospective_tariff_for_a_telecom_company

Customers of Megaline, a federal cellular operator, are offered two tariff plans: Smart and Ultra. In order to adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which plan brings in the most money.

It is necessary to make a preliminary analysis of tariffs on a small sample of clients. We have at our disposal the data of 500 "Megaline" users: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. You need to analyze customer behavior and draw a conclusion about which tariff is better.
